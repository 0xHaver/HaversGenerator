**HaversGenerator**

HaversGenerator is a simple Python script that generates unique gift card codes consisting of 16 characters. The generated codes are outputted to a .txt file on your computer. There are many services that use 16 character gift card codes that you can use this as a generator for in theory, such as for Fortnite V-Bucks, however, we do not suggest using this to attempt claiming any codes you do not have ownership of. This is a generic code generator and not meant to defraud or cause harm to any project, game, website, or company. Users use this at their own discretion and I am not responsible.
